# PersonalWebsite_CK
This repo is for a website I created that has information about me and the work I've done.

## Description
This repo contains the code for my personal website. This repo also contains a build and release pipeline that is triggered through changes going into main. The website has information about me and the projects I've done. This is my first, and so far, only website. The website is built with NET Core 8.0. Since it is built with NET Core it mainly uses a C# and Razorpages foundation. The website contains a main page which give an overview of me and my career. A Contact Me page where you can fill out a form and send me an email. A Github Projects page that contains links to GitHub projects that I have done over the years. As well as a brief description of each project.

The website itself is hosted in Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Docker Containers.
